Title: Using python for machine learning with large gridded datasets



Summary: 

In this talk, I will discuss the tools behind some of my recent work building
machine-learned components for climate models. A typical machine learning
pipeline consists of three stages: 1) data munging , 2) model training, and 3)
model evaluation. The corresponding libraries I use for each of these stages
are 1) xarray, 2) scikit-learn and PyTorch, and 3) HoloViews and matplotlib for
visualization. I will demonstrate how all these tools come together on a simple
example problem. Time permitting, I will also discuss how to embed python-based
machine learning models within a Fortran climate model.
